                    <p>I grew up on a native American reservation in northern California, in an isolated mountain household with extremely limited access to technology. As you might imagine, I was not one of those kids who was messing around in the command line at the age of 10. In fact, my family didn't even have a <em>phone!</em> </p>

                    <p> The first computer that I had access to could do two things; it could run an MS Word and it could play King's Quest VI: Heir Today Gone Tomorrow.</p>

               <p> I grade school we were sometimes taken to a dim little computer lab where we were taught to touch-type. In my case, they failed.</p>

                <h1>Oops! </h1>
                    <p>About 5/6 of the way through my bachelor I came across a particular YouTube series while studying for an exam. </p>

                    <h4>Crash Course Computer Science</h4>
                
                <p>I considered a computer science degree, but I was already close to finishing my BS in biology. Meanwhile, I had heard bout launchcode, and it seemed like I was encountering more and more people who hd either been through the program themselves or had been successfully self-taught to code. SO I decided to apply, and here I am.</p>
