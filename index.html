                    <p>I grew up on a native American reservation in northern California, in an isolated mountain household with extremely limited access to technology. As you might imagine, I was not one of those kids who was messing around in the command line at the age of 10. In fact, my family didn't even have a <em>phone!</em> </p>

                    <h4> King's Quest 6, the only PC game I had growing up.</h4>

                    <p> The first computer that I had access to could do two things as far as I could tell; it could run an MS Word and it could play King's Quest 6.</p>
